## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis was to use Tableau to evaluate bike rental data from Citibike in New York City from August 2019.  We would like to use this data to inform a possible bike sharing business in Des Moines.


## Results:

The most popular starting locations were clustered around Madison Square Park.  This area is close to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.

The most popular times to rent a bike were between 7-9am and 5-7pm on weekdays - Thursday being the most popular day.  On weekends any time around mid-day was busiest.

Our gender analysis showed that there were many more male customers than female, but time and usage habits are very similar for the two.

## Summary:
Although these data are from New York City - a far denser and more populous city than Des Moines, the time of day and gender usage data is relevant.  The biggest takeaway is that bike rental is most popular around locations with a great deal of pedestrian traffic - e.g. transportation hubs, stadiums, and tourist hotspots.
